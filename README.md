# personality-test

Simple personality test made for my mother's business.


I'd like to express many thanks to Florin Pop - I learned how to do it from his channel.

I just started coding, so I'm sure I've made many mistakes in this project. But also I've learned quite a lot.
If you want to correct some of my errors, feel free to do that - I'm looking forward to learn something new.
